# House Designer Project
This project is a minimal design tool for house layouts. It is intended to be used to compare and contrast different house footprints with a floor plan, furniture, and walls.

## Usage
### Creating a workspace
To start, enter a name for your workspace, select the Width and Length, and select Create.

When a workspace is created, there is a grid in the middle. This is the blueprint of your property space. It can be moved and resized as needed.

This will create your workspace in which you may add furniture, walls, or more floors!

### Workspace features
#### Walls
This category of item represent walls to define your house layout. Note that in the current version, there is only one type of wall, whether it is intended as external or internal does not make a difference.

To add a wall, select Walls from the Item Bank, select 'Create Wall'. On the grid, you must then click on the desired starting location and ending location for the wall. To delete the wall, select 'Delete Wall' from the Item Bank option, then click on the wall you wish to delete.

#### Furniture
This category of items represent your furniture (such as chairs, tables, beds, etc) as well as your applicances (such as washer, dryer, etc). Furniture dimensions are outlined in the top right of the respective item.

To add a furniture, drag the desired piece from the Item Bank section onto the grid. Selecting the furniture item once in your grid, you may move it, rotate it, or delete it (alternatively, dragging the item away from the grid will also delete the item).

You can also create your own furniture, with specified dimensions, using the Custom feature. Select 'Custom' from the furniture menu and select 'Create Item +'.

#### Floors
Each workspace may have up to 5 floors. Floors have the same dimensions of grid, though furniture and walls are unique. Add or delete floors in the bottom left of the workspace.
